OFiX
====

I like to download my transaction history from various financial institutions into Microsoft Money.

Up until now this has been a painless procedure, but recently I opened up an account with a new bank that doesn't handle special characters correctly (the ampersand in particular), and so it's not so painless anymore.

I reported this issue to the bank, who acknowledged that their "web team" is aware of the issue, but so far they haven't fixed the problem.

So tiring of the manual "save OFX, replace & with &amp;, open OFX" process, I wrote OFiX.  Just tell your web browser to open OFX files with OFiX and it'll automatically fix those &'s for you and make Microsoft Money a whole lot happier.

TL;DR version: Your bank doesn't care that they're generating invalid OFX files? OFiX will make them valid for you.
